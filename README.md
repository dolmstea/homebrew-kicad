kicad-homebrew
==============

A tap containing a Homebrew formula to build the Kicad EDA software suite.

This is currently not working due to the clang narrowing error. The vast majority of the rest
of the compiler issues have been sorted out at this point, we're just still working on little
things. Hopefully a working release will be available in the coming days or weeks.
