kicad-homebrew
==============

A tap containing a Homebrew formula to build the Kicad EDA software suite.

Status: This formula now builds with no problems, but has only been tested on OSX Yosemite.
The Kicad libraries are not included and work is being done to include them in the next release
of this formula.

Does not, and will not, work on OSX releases before 10.7 (Lion).
