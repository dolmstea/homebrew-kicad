kicad-homebrew
==============

A tap containing a Homebrew formula to build the Kicad EDA software suite.

This is currently not working due to a strange compiler error having to do with the code trying to
cast an integer as a bool pointer. The vast majority of the rest
of the compiler issues have been sorted out at this point, we're just still working on little
things. Hopefully a working release will be available in the coming days or weeks.

Does not, and will not, work on OSX releases before 10.7 (Lion).
